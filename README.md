# Santella site â€” Apache on port 5000

This project is built with Vite + React and served via Apache HTTP Server inside a Docker container.

## Quick start

1) Build the site

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

2) Run Apache on port 5000 (containerized)

```bash
docker run -d --name santella-httpd \
  -p 5000:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/dist:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/apache/httpd.conf:/usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf:ro \
  httpd:2.4
```

3) Open the site

- http://localhost:5000
- Deep links (SPA) like http://localhost:5000/produtos will also work.

## Contact form (Formspree)

The contact form posts to Formspree. Configure your form id:

1. Create a form at https://formspree.io/ and copy the form id (e.g., `xpwjelnl`).
2. Create `.env.local` with:

```
VITE_FORMSPREE_ID=your_form_id
```

3. Rebuild the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes:
- A fallback id `xpwjelnl` is used if the env var is not set.
- We append `_subject` and `_replyto` to improve inbox handling.
- On success, a toast confirms the message was sent.
- Optionally configure auto-reply and notifications in Formspree dashboard.

## Stop / remove

```bash
docker stop santella-httpd
# optional: remove container
docker rm santella-httpd
```

## Notes

- The Apache config at `apache/httpd.conf` enables a Single Page App fallback to `index.html` using `mod_rewrite`.
- If you change the app, rebuild with `npm run build` and the container will serve the updated `dist/` files.
- To mount a custom favicon or images, place them in `public/` before building. Currently images load from `src/assets/`.
